    <h2>I'm a huge nerd, I enjoy watching Marvel and DC movies, anime, listening to a wide variety of music,  spend majority of my time on my Ps4 and also eating. I have a passion for technology. Anything geeky will more than likely get my attention.</h2>

    <li class="navItem">Facts</li>
    <p>I am 22 years old my birthday is May 22, 1996. I was born in Columbus, Ga, I moved to Virginia because my dad was in the Army. This is my second time coming back to atlanta, before I moved here I was back in Columbus for another 8 years and then I came back in January of 2015. I have a little brother who is 18. I've only had one lfie threatning injury, which was when i busted my forehead open on the sharp side of a tall shelf. I am near-sighted with a little bit of astigmatism. The only pet I ever had was a fish, which sucked because it died 3 days later. In 2017 I built my first gaming PC.  </p>
    
    <li class="navItem">Plans</li>
    <p>My plans after I graduate from this program are to hopefully land a career and get paid a very nice salary. I want to live comfortably and be able to travel to Hawaii, Japan, and South Korea. My plans are simple. This is all I want, to be able to live comfortably. Just make good money, travel, play my video games, and eat thats it.</p>
